### Premier League Transfer Spend Analysis 2014 to 2024

At the end of every Premier League season, football fans look for something new to fixate on until the next season starts. This usually results in consuming an excessive amount of transfer speculations for their team, their league, or even some random 3rd-tier Norwegian team. Inevitably, unrest and hyperfixation on transfer speculations results in football fans wanting big transfers to happen in the window, as that results in better performance for the team in the next season. Right?

This analysis seeks to explore the often-asserted assertion: "More Money = Better Performance." To facilitate this analysis, I gathered historical data from Premier League transfer windows, match results, and wage bills to determine the effect that transfer window spend had on subsequent season success.

### File System Breakdown
- csvs: contains all datasets used for the analyses.
- EDAs: contains 3 jupyter notebooks with analyses for match results, transfers, and transfer spend (analysis.ipynb).
- Web Scraping Scripts: contains the web scraping scripts used to gather data.

### Limitations
Some data was scraped from websites with user-inputted data, which is not explicitly cited. This may have a negative effect on the accuracy of the analyses, specifically regarding actual transfer fees.
